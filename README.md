## Correct Declaration Classification

**Prerequisites:**

- Work with Google Colab
- Ensure that your dataset is saved in the same directory as the script and is named 'data.csv'.
- The dataset must contain a column named 'label' which represents your target variable. This column should have integer values.

**Steps:**
  
- Once you've ensured the prerequisites are met, simply run the provided script.
- Upon successful execution, a file named model.cbm will be generated in the current directory. This file contains the trained weights of the CatBoost model.

With these simple steps, you can easily train and save your CatBoost model. Happy modeling!
